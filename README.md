======================
   //1- Implement linear search on an array.
	  (Bouns)handle cases where the array contains multiple occurrences of the target element.Display all indices where the target element is found.

   
   //2- Implement function for Binary searech algorithm using Iterative Method (loop).

   
   //3- Implement function for BubleSort for doubly linked list.(Swap data) (bouns Swap nodes)
